1. In this assignment, I have used ipython notebooks.
2. The Frozen Lake has two notebooks. One for VI/PI algorithms and one for Q-Learning algorithms.
3. The Forest Management has two notebooks. One for 20 states and one for 500 states. I'm sorry for different classification.
4. The required packages are in requirements.txt.
5. The notebooks can be downloaded using this git command (The repository is public):

git clone https://github.com/okazkayasi/CS7641.git

6. To run any algorithm, please open the corresponding notebook and run all cells in order (Run All can be done on Run tab).
